# Interactive Totoro
Final project for Introduction to Interactive Media class developed in Processing. 
This interactive experience allows users to interact with Studio Ghibli's famous character, Totoro through the PS3Eye and Blob Detection libraries in Processing. 

Users are encouaged to play with Totoro by either wearing a glove to stroke his belly or by using an umbrella to cover him from the rain. Through various IR lights attached to both objects, the program tracks their location, triggering different aspects: the movement of Totoro's eyes and smile, the stopping of rain, and various growling sounds.
